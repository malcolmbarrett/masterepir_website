## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> This section is completely optional

I recommend learning targets as soon as you can, but you may want to wait until after the course is over if you feel like you're still digesting the rest of the course content.

Why might you want to learn targets? targets is a tool for managing your code workflows in a reproducible and scaleable way. In short, targets manages your code so that you only re-run what needs to be re-run. 

targets is brand new, but I have used its predecessor (drake) extensively. I use code pipelines for *every* project. I cannot recommend it enough!
