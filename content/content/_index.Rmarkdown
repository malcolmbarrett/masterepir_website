Welcome to Mastering R for Epidemiologic Research! On this page, you'll find information about all the content related to the course: videos, exercises, assignments, suggested readings, and so on.
- **Required content** is just that: core content that you must complete. In this course, required content will generally be recorded lectures and supplementary exercises available on RStudio Cloud. We will also have 4 assignments to complete.
- **Suggested content** is usually a closely-related set of readings, videos, or tutorials. You might find it useful to supplement your learning during the course or to review after the course is over. 
- **Suggested exercises** are a set of additional exercises, usually from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), that you might find helpful for more practice.
- **Bonus material** is usually a deeper dive into the subject or another helpful perspective. You might want to come back to this down the line. These materials can also be helpful if you just need a little more information to fully digest the module content.


## <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Make sure that you have joined the RStudio Cloud workspace at http://bit.ly/master_r_epi_mar21. 

This course is very hands-on and will require you to complete exercises and assignments in RStudio Cloud for each module. See the [Setup and Introduction](00-content/) page for more information.

*Tip*: Make sure you always make a copy of the module in RStudio Cloud! The best way to do this is to press the “+ Copy” button. If you don't, you'll only make a temporary copy, and your changes won't be saved until you save a copy of your own.

Note that modules marked “Assignment” will automatically make a copy, as well as save all your changes while you work; you do not need to do anything extra for assignments.
