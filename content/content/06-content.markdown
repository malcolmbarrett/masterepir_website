## Required content
- <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> Assignment 2: Modeling data ([see below](#lecture-modeling-data))
- <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> In addition to completing the tasks in the assignment, we must be able to run your code successfully on RStudio Cloud. Use a [blank slate](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#always-start-r-with-a-blank-slate) and restart your R session regularly, running all of the code to make sure it works correctly. Regularly checking your code with a blank slate will make sure things work as you intend.

## Bonus material

## Lecture: Modeling data 

### Exercises

You can find the assignment under `07-modeling_and_broom`. 

**Please complete the assignment on RStudio Cloud.** You do not need to formally submit the assignment; we can see your workspace, so the most recent state of your `exercises.Rmd` file is what we will grade.
