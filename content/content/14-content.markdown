## Required content
- <i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> Assignment 4: Shiny Challenge ([see below](#assignment-shiny-challenge))
- <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> In addition to completing the tasks in the assignment, we must be able to run your code successfully on RStudio Cloud. Use a [blank slate](https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html#always-start-r-with-a-blank-slate) and restart your R session regularly, running all of the code to make sure it works correctly. Regularly checking your code with a blank slate will make sure things work as you intend.


## Assignment: Shiny Challenge

In this assignment, we'll create a Shiny app for the gapminder dataset using skills from earlier in the course. You'll also need to learn how to do some new things in Shiny. Not only will you practice the skills we've learned so far, but you'll also practice finding and internalizing new techniques from community resources. The R ecosystem is always growing, and it's a good habit to start reading some of the excellent material already out there. Here are some that will help you with this assignment:

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 3 of Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-ui.html)
- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 4 of Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-reactivity.html)
- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Tabsets in Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tabsets.html)

You can find the assignment under `15-shiny_challenge`. 

Your app doesn't need to look exactly like mine, but here's what my solution looks like:

**Please complete the assignment on RStudio Cloud.** You do not need to formally submit the assignment; we can see your workspace, so the most recent state of your `app.R` file is what we will grade.
