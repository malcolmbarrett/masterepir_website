I am a data scientist, an R developer, and an epidemiologist. My work in public health has spanned clinical education, health data science courses, and research for clinical and cohort studies. Previously, I was an intern at RStudio, and I served two years in AmeriCorps at federally-qualified health centers in Michigan and New York City.
